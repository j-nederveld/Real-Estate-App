Overview of the project: 
    As a homebuyer, I want to see greater information on the area that I am looking at in order to be more confident in my home buying purchase. 

    Users will be able to input a US zipcode, and return properties in that area, as well as Geo Data concerning the specified area. (ex. crime rates, average weather, average population age/income/education level...).
