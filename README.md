Overview of the project: 
    As a homebuyer, I want to see greater information on the area that I am looking at in order to be more confident in my real estate purchase. 

    Users will be able to input a US zipcode, and return properties in that area, as well as Geo Data concerning the specified area. (ex. crime rates, average weather, average population age/income/education level...).

Presentation requirements -

Elevator pitch: This is a real estate app that provideds localised data as well as the information of the house or apartment. 

Concept: 
        What is your user story: As a homebuyer. 
            I want to see greater information on the area that I am looking at.
            In order to be more confident in my real estate purchase. 
        What was your motivation for development?:
              Whenever I randomly look though area's and houses on zillow I always wantted infromation on the area the property was located in and the propertly, But they only really have information on the property. Causing me to have to use a different website for addtional infromation. The application aleviates that by add the infromation on the same page as the real estae propery.

Process: 
    What were the technologies used?: HTML,CSS,JS,Jquery,API's,Uikit 
    How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned?: Elliot: HTML/CSS/Uikit
                                                        Samer: HTML/CSS/Uikit
                                                        JP: JS/Jquery/API
                                                        Lyric: JS/Jquery/API
    What challenges did you encounter?: All Crime rate API suck 
    What were your successes?: Getting all the other API's too work

Directions for Future Development:
                                    Get a functioning crime rate API
                                    Add a map that displays more infromation like "attractions" and "resturants"
                                    Make the UI more modern
